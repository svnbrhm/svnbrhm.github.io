<h3 id="himeji-intro">Welcome to Himeji</h3>

<p>Himeji is a historic castle town in Hyogo Prefecture, best known for its magnificent UNESCO World Heritage-listed castle. Often called "White Heron Castle" (Shirasagi-jo) due to its elegant white exterior, Himeji Castle is widely considered Japan's most beautiful and complete feudal castle. The city has preserved much of its traditional character while developing into a modern regional center.</p>

<p>With a population of around 530,000, Himeji offers a more relaxed pace than major cities like Osaka or Tokyo, making it perfect for experiencing authentic Japanese culture. Beyond the castle, the city boasts beautiful gardens, historic temples, and distinctive local cuisine including Himeji oden (with unique ginger-soy sauce) and anago-meshi (conger eel rice).</p>

    <li><strong>Etiquette:</strong> Keep conversations quiet, set phones to silent mode, and avoid taking calls in the seating area (use the areas between cars instead).</li>
    <li><strong>Views:</strong> Try to get a window seat on the right side (traveling east) for potential Mt. Fuji views if the weather is clear.</li>
    <li><strong>Amenities:</strong> Most Shinkansen have power outlets at seats and some have WiFi.</li>
   </ul>

    <p>Kissaten are traditional Japanese coffee houses that flourished from the post-war era through the 1980s. Unlike modern chain cafés, they focus on meticulously prepared coffee (often using siphon brewing methods), classic light meals, and a relaxed atmosphere where customers can linger.

   <h4>About Himeji Castle</h4>
   <p>Himeji Castle (姫路城, Himeji-jō) is Japan's most spectacular castle and one of the few original castles remaining (not a reconstruction). Built in the early 17th century, it's renowned for its elegant white exterior, complex defensive systems, and remarkable preservation. The castle has survived wars, earthquakes, and bombing raids that destroyed many other Japanese castles.</p>
   
   <p>The castle underwent a major restoration completed in 2015, restoring its brilliant white appearance. While you'll save the interior visit for tomorrow, today's exterior view gives you a perfect introduction to what is widely considered Japan's finest castle.</p>
   
   <h4>Walking Route</h4>
   <p>From Himeji Station, walk straight north up the broad Otemae-dori boulevard for about 15-20 minutes. The castle will be visible for most of your walk, growing more impressive as you approach. The outer grounds and Sannomaru Square are free to enter and offer excellent views of the castle exterior.</p>
